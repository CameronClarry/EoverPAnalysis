Configuring
===========

config_* scripts
----------------

In 'scripts' you'll find files with names like 'config_*' (ex. 'config_data.py'). These files set the run options, i.e. what event and track selection to apply, what histograms to make, etc. Create your own as needed!

run_condor_* scripts
--------------------

In 'scripts' you'll also find files with names such as 'run_condor_*' (ex. 'run_condor_test_eop_lowmu.sh'). These let you automate submission to condor (see 'First condor test run' above for instructions).
