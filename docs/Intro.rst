Introduction
============

Welcome to the documentation for the RootCore package `EoverPAnalysis <https://github.com/jmrolsson/EoverPAnalysis>`_, which is using the `xAODAnaHelpers <https://github.com/UCATLAS/xAODAnaHelpers>`_ analysis framework. This package is intended for ATLAS Run 2 E/p analysis, and is intended to be used with datasets from the `E/p xAOD derivation <https://github.com/jmrolsson/EoverPxAOD>`_ (so far it is only compatible with this derivation).
